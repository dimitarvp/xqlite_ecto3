# Backlog — xqlite_ecto3 (review program)

Severity per the ratified bar in `xqlite/REVIEW_AXES.md`. Nothing
here is ever silently dropped; S3s get a committed closer-look pass
after the S0–S2 burn-down.

## Pre-publish gates (release-readiness, regardless of severity)

- [G1] 21 accidental-public SQL helpers in `Connection` → `defp`
  (verify the zero-external-caller claim per function first;
  includes the `insert_all/1,2` name-confusion hazard). (wave-1)
- [G2] ECTO_INTEGRATION_TAGS.md reconciliation: drop the orphaned
  `:concurrent_poolrepo_transactions` row; rewrite the stale
  `:foreign_key_constraint` row; fix headers (SQLite 3.51.3 →
  3.53.2; 15/18 → 16/18); thicken the two vague rows after the
  two-tag probe. (wave-1)
- [G3] Elixir floor: `~> 1.15` claimed, CI floor 1.17 — add lanes
  or raise the floor (floor-raise = Dimi values call; identical gap
  in xqlite). (wave-1)
- [G5] CLAUDE.md bootstrap (content list inventoried in
  `~/kod/fleet_review_staging/recon/recon_adapter_distilled.md`).

## Probes (orchestrator-run)

- [P1] Two-tag status probe: run the suite isolating
  `:transaction_checkout_raises` and `:values_list` — resolves the
  ledger-vs-README contradiction; failures get classified per the
  bar. (B2)
- [B3] connect-time PRAGMA storm under pool cold-start;
  wedged-txn-state symmetry. (The `:memory:` + pool_size guard probe
  RAN in Run 2 and confirmed a defect — see F-B3-1 below.)
- [B9] Verify CI builds AND tests both telemetry compile configs.

## Open (S3 — tracked, never dropped)

- [F-B8-1] (S3) Operation `:timeout` does not interrupt a lock-contended
  write — `busy_timeout` dominates. Two handles on one file: A holds
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, B (`busy_timeout: 3000`) INSERTs with a 300 ms cancel
  token → `{:error, {:database_busy_or_locked, 5, …}}` after **3005 ms**,
  not 300 ms. SQLite's progress handler (which polls the cancel token) is
  not called while blocked in the busy-wait, so the token fires only once
  stepping resumes. Bounded by `busy_timeout` (adapter default 5000 ms) —
  the flagship promptness guarantee covers CPU-bound execution, not lock
  waits. Could be argued S2 (headline-behaviour divergence); filed S3 as
  bounded + doc-remedy. Options: document prominently; lower the default
  `busy_timeout`; or (xqlite change) a busy handler that polls the token.
  (Run 3, B8)
- [F-B8-2] (S3) The streaming path ignores `:timeout`.
  `handle_declare`/`handle_fetch` create no cancel token, and xqlite 0.10.0
  exposes no cancellable `stream_fetch` (only `stream_fetch/2`). A
  `Repo.stream(slow_query, …)` under `run(timeout: 200)` ran the whole
  recursive CTE to completion (**3503 ms**, returned `[[10000000]]`);
  DBConnection's deadline logged a disconnect at 200 ms but could not
  interrupt the blocked dirty NIF. Cross-repo (X2): a fix needs an xqlite
  `stream_fetch_cancellable` first, then wire a per-fetch token like
  `execute_with_cancel`. Interim: document that stream batches are
  uncancellable and to keep `max_rows` modest. (Run 3, B8)

- [F-B3-1] No guard on private-`:memory:` + a multi-connection pool.
  `database: ":memory:"` with NO `pool_size` (Ecto default 10) starts
  cleanly, but each private in-memory connection is a SEPARATE database:
  a `CREATE`/`INSERT` lands on one pooled connection while reads scatter
  across the others. Probe (Run 2): 10 reads of a just-inserted row gave
  9× `{:error, :no_such_table}` + 1× `{:ok, []}` (empty table) + 0× the
  row. Default-reachable and produces a wholly broken repo, but fails
  LOUDLY (`:no_such_table`), and the remedy is a maintainer design call —
  `ecto_sqlite3` raises here; options are (a) raise at `child_spec` when
  the database is `":memory:"`/`""` and `pool_size > 1`, (b) auto-force
  `pool_size: 1`, or (c) document `file::memory:?cache=shared` as the
  shared-pool form. Related: the adapter's advertised `@default_opts`
  `pool_size: 5` is dead — pool sizing is consumed by Ecto before
  `child_spec` merges defaults, so Ecto's default 10 wins. (Run 2, B3)
- [F-B5-1] `to_constraints/2` returns `[foreign_key: nil]` when an FK
  violation has no rich-diagnostics payload (default `rich_fk_diagnostics:
  false`, or a diagnosis that finds no rows). `nil` is not a valid
  constraint name: with the default `match: :exact` it never matches a
  user `foreign_key_constraint/3` (→ `Ecto.ConstraintError` with a `nil`
  name — confusing but tolerable), but with `match: :suffix`/`:prefix`
  Ecto's `constraints_to_errors` runs `String.ends_with?(nil, cc)` and
  crashes with a `FunctionClauseError` (verified: `String.ends_with?(nil,
  "x")` raises). Latent (narrow trigger); consider returning `[]` (raw
  error) or synthesizing the `<source>_<field>_fkey` name from
  `options[:source]`. (Run 2, B5)
- [X1-2] `Error.wrap/1`'s generic `{tag, msg}` clause requires
  `is_binary(msg)`, so ~14 documented `error_reason/0` shapes with a
  map/int/atom/tuple payload fall to the `inspect` catch-all and lose
  their `type` tag (`:integral_value_out_of_range`,
  `:cannot_convert_to_sqlite_value`, `:cannot_execute_pragma`,
  `:invalid_parameter_count`, `:invalid_column_type`,
  `:from_sql_conversion_failure`, `:cannot_open_database`,
  `:invalid_open_option`, `:invalid_pages_per_step`,
  `:invalid_authorizer_action`, `:invalid_column_index`,
  `:unsupported_data_type`, `:schema_parsing_error`,
  `:invalid_on_error`). Still valid exceptions, never misclassified —
  unclassified. Completeness. A 2nd X1 pass decides: add clauses or
  ratify inspect-fallback as intended for exotic shapes. (Run 1)
- [B1-1] `dump_cmd/3` is a required `Ecto.Adapter.Structure` callback
  (no `@optional_callbacks`) but the adapter `raise`s. Unreachable via
  mix tasks (`mix ecto.dump` uses `structure_dump/2`), so harmless —
  but consider a structured `{:error, ...}` or a moduledoc note. Same
  entry: `storage_up/1` MatchErrors on `XqliteNIF.open` failure
  instead of returning `{:error, term}` (near-impossible path). (Run 1)
- [S3] docs `groups_for_modules` lists 3 `@moduledoc false` modules
  (dead config). (wave-1)
- [S3] Untracked `.expert/` root clutter — gitignore or remove
  (Dimi's call). (wave-1)
- [S3] test_helper's `logging.exs:74` exclusion rationale is thin —
  state permanent-vs-trackable. (wave-1)
- [S3] `async: false` ban is honored (0/52) but written down
  nowhere in this repo — codify in the CLAUDE.md bootstrap. (wave-1)

## Feature follow-ups (owed, not review findings)

- [A2] hooks config `:busy` kind + busy-aware concurrency docs —
  unlocked by xqlite 0.9.0's busy split.
- [A3] Optionally migrate raw `XqliteNIF.txn_state/connection_stats`
  doc references to the new `Xqlite` wrappers (additive, optional).

## Closed

- 2026-07-20 [F-B4-1] (S1) A `:decimal` column maps to `DECIMAL` (NUMERIC
  affinity); the encode boundary bound `Decimal.to_string(d, :normal)` as
  TEXT and SQLite coerced it to float64 at write, silently rounding decimals
  beyond float64's exact precision (`12345678901234567890.12345` → REAL
  `1.2345678901234567e19`, loads back unequal). Maintainer ruling (Dimi,
  2026-07-20): LOUD REJECT beyond precision, keep numeric storage so
  ordering/range queries still work. Added
  `XqliteEcto3.DecimalPrecision.representable?/1` (Decimal → float64 →
  shortest round-trip string → Decimal, compared normalized) guarding
  `encode_param/1`; a non-round-tripping Decimal now raises structured
  `XqliteEcto3.DecimalPrecisionError` (carries `:value`) instead of storing a
  rounded number. Typical money (≤15 sig digits, incl. `9999999999999.99`)
  and float-exact large ints still store fine — the guard's accept/reject
  verdict was cross-checked against a real SQLite DECIMAL round-trip and
  agreed for every probed value. Docs flipped from "silently truncated" to
  loud-reject in the moduledoc + `data_type.ex`; the pin test flipped from
  `refute Decimal.equal?` to `assert_raise`. RED→green in
  `types_roundtrip_matrix_test.exs` + `query_encoding_test.exs`; guard table
  in `decimal_precision_test.exs`. (Run 3, B4)
- 2026-07-20 [F-B7-1] (S2) `reference_on_delete/1` handled only the
  whole-key atoms and fell through to `[]` for Ecto's valid column-list
  forms `on_delete: {:nilify, cols}` / `{:default, cols}`, SILENTLY
  dropping the entire `ON DELETE` clause (`CONSTRAINT … REFERENCES
  "parents"("id")` with no action). SQLite has no column-list ON DELETE
  syntax; fixed to raise a loud `ArgumentError` pointing at `:nilify_all`
  / `:default_all`. (`on_update` tuples are Ecto-rejected upstream.)
  RED→green in `migration_test.exs` "reference ON DELETE". (Run 3, B7)
- 2026-07-20 [F-B6-1] (S1) `escape_string/1` doubled backslashes for
  inline SQL string literals (`WHERE`/`LIKE` literals, DDL string
  defaults). SQLite treats `\` as an ordinary character, so `'a\\b'` is a
  4-char value — an inlined `x == "a\b"` silently matched nothing. Fixed
  to escape only the single quote; `escape_json_key/1` keeps its
  backslash+quote escaping locally (JSON-path output byte-identical).
  RED→green in `query_features_test.exs` + `connection_test.exs`. (Run 2, B6)
- 2026-07-20 [F-B6-2] (S2) offset without limit emitted a bare `OFFSET n`,
  which is a SQLite syntax error (`near "OFFSET"`). A legitimate paginating
  query (`from x, offset: 2`) failed to compile. Fixed: `limit/2` emits
  `LIMIT -1` when limit is nil but offset is present. The pre-existing
  "offset without limit" test masked this with `limit: 999`; rewritten to
  the genuine case. RED→green in `query_features_test.exs`. (Run 2, B6)
- 2026-07-20 [F-B6-3] (S2) `quote_entity/1` did not escape an embedded `"`
  in identifiers, so a runtime `fragment("?", identifier(^value))` with a
  crafted value broke out of the quotes and injected SQL
  (`SELECT "x" FROM secrets;--"`). Fixed by doubling `"` → `""` (mirroring
  `FkDiagnostics.quote_ident/1`, which was already correct). RED→green in
  `connection_test.exs`. (Run 2, B6)
- 2026-07-20 [F-X2-1] (S2) statement-cache path leaked sticky
  `sqlite3_changes()` as `num_rows` for columnless non-DML (DDL/
  PRAGMA) statements — fixed via `total_changes`-delta gating in the
  driver, RED→green in `driver_statement_cache_test.exs`. (Run 1)
- 2026-07-20 [F-X1-1] (S3) `wrap/1` `:sqlite_failure` clause dropped
  the type-permitted nil-message variant — fixed, RED→green in
  `error_wrap_test.exs`. (Run 1)
- 2026-07-17 xqlite dep 0.8.0 → 0.9.0 (lock bump, hex-mode verify).
- 2026-07-17 erl_crash.dump: autopsied, dev-noise, stays gitignored.
